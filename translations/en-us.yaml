share:
  title: Share your details with your contacts
  text: |
    <p>Choose which details you want to share with your contacts in your addressbook. Your details are never sent over
    the wire unencrypted, and only the recipient is able to decrypt the information thanks to the encryption algorithm
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>.</p>
    <p>How does the process work?</p>
    <p>For every contact in your addressbook the following happens:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The server is asked for the contacts public key.</li>
    <li>Your information is decrypted with the received key.</li>
    <li>The decrypted information is sent to the server.</li>
    <li>When the recipient logs into his addressbook, she receives the encrypted information and decrypts it with
    her private key.</li>
    </ol>
